  <h1>CS 180 Project 5A – Diffusion Models</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Mansoor Mamnoon</p>
  <p><strong>Random Seed:</strong> 180</p>

  <h2>Part 0: Playing with DeepFloyd IF</h2>

  <p>
    I used the DeepFloyd IF two-stage diffusion model via Hugging Face. I generated my own
    prompt embeddings using the provided Hugging Face cluster, then loaded the resulting
    <code>prompt_embeds_dict.pth</code> file into my environment. For all experiments below,
    I fixed the random seed to <code>180</code> for reproducibility.
  </p>

  <h3>Prompts</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>"A giant mechanical peacock made of bronze gears and stained glass, opening its tail in the middle of Times Square at night."</li>
    <li>"A Victorian-era astronaut reading a book inside a candle-lit library on the moon."</li>
    <li>"A warm, cozy cottage made out of chocolate and gingerbread, with smoke shaped like cinnamon rolls drifting from the chimney."</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Reflection on Image Quality and Alignment</h3>

  <p><strong>Prompt 1 – Mechanical peacock in Times Square.</strong>
    The model produces a very vibrant peacock with a stained-glass-like tail and metallic-looking body,
    which matches the “mechanical” and “stained glass” parts of the prompt well. In the 256×256 image,
    the background has bright lights and tall buildings that resemble Times Square at night.
    The overall composition is coherent, but some of the gear details in the feathers are abstract
    rather than clearly defined gears.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Prompt 2 – Victorian-era astronaut in a candle-lit library on the moon.</strong>
    The image shows a figure in an old-fashioned uniform reading a large book in front of floor-to-ceiling shelves.
    The warm directional light fits the “candle-lit” setting. A planet visible through the window
    suggests a lunar location. The model captures the mood of a Victorian library well, but the “astronaut”
    concept is stylized and does not look like a modern spacesuit.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Prompt 3 – Chocolate and gingerbread cottage with cinnamon-roll smoke.</strong>
    The cottage clearly looks like a gingerbread house: the walls and roof have cookie and icing textures,
    and there are candy-like decorations and trees. The scene feels warm and cozy despite the snow.
    The smoke from the chimney has a slight spiral structure, but it does not perfectly form distinct
    cinnamon-roll shapes. Overall, the model is strong at the “dessert house” concept, but struggles with
    this very specific geometric detail.
  </p>

  <h3>Effect of <code>num_inference_steps</code> (Prompt 1)</h3>

  <div class="img-row">
    <div class="img-col">
      <img src="img/peacock_10steps.png" alt="Peacock, 10 steps">
      <div class="caption">Prompt 1 – 10 denoising steps</div>
    </div>
    <div class="img-col">
      <img src="img/peacock_50steps.png" alt="Peacock, 50 steps">
      <div class="caption">Prompt 1 – 50 denoising steps</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    For this comparison I fixed the seed to 180 and only changed <code>num_inference_steps</code>.
    With <strong>10 steps</strong>, the global structure of the peacock is present, but the textures in the
    feathers and background are blurrier and contain more small artifacts. With <strong>50 steps</strong>,
    the same basic composition is preserved, but the feathers and stained-glass patterns are sharper and more
    detailed, and the city lights look more stable. This matches the intuition that more denoising steps let
    the diffusion process refine the image more thoroughly, trading extra compute time for better visual quality.
